# cljs.java.time

A Clojurescript library that provides the jsr-310 (java.time) api. 

Since v0.1.16 this requires Clojurescript version 1.10.741 or higher 

Underneath this lib is a pure JS implementation of java.time. This library just aims to make that 
library usable from Clojurescript:

* it adds Clojurescript's equivalence, hash and comparison protocols to the java.time
domain objects
* it provides externs
* the java.time packages are mirrored by Clojurescript namespaces.
 
## Related Libraries

[cljc.java-time](https://github.com/henryw374/cljc.java-time) offers a one for one mapping of the classes and methods from
java.time into a Clojure(Script) library 
 
Using that library is [tick](https://clojars.org/tick), an intuitive Clojure(Script) library for dealing with time, intended as a replacement for clj-time. 

[time-literals](https://github.com/henryw374/time-literals) is a Clojure(Script) library which provides tagged literals for objects from jsr-310 domain and depends on this library
  
[my talk at Clojure/North 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFuL-ZDoB2U) provides some background

## Usage

get it from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/cljs.java-time) 

```
(require '[java.time :refer [LocalDate]])

(.parse LocalDate "2020-01-01")
```

### Shadow-Cljs 

At least one Shadow build (node-test) needs to be manually provided with externs, ie

```
:compiler-options {:externs ["cljsjs/js-joda/common/js-joda-dup.ext.js"]}
```

Shadow browser build and regular node build do not need any additional opts.

### Cross Platform (.cljc) Example

```
(ns foo
  (:require
    #?(:cljs [java.time :refer [LocalDate]])
    [time-literals.read-write]
    [cljs.java-time.interop :as t.i])
   #?(:clj (:import [java.time LocalDate])))
   
   
  (. LocalDate parse "2020-12-01")
  ;=> #time/date"2020-12-01"
  
  (= 
    (. LocalDate parse "2020-12-01")
    (. LocalDate parse "2020-12-01"))
  ; => true  
  
  ; call a getter method
  (let [l (. LocalDate parse "2020-12-01")]
    (t.i/getter dayOfMonth l))
  
```

### Getter Methods
Unfortunately, all java.time getter methods have had the 'get' part of their name removed in the underlying 
 js lib. So instead of 'getNano' method, you have 'nano'. As a workaround, to write cross platform code that calls any getter methods on java.time objects, use the
`cljs.java-time.interop/getter` macro



### NPM Dependency 

The npm library that provides the jsr-310 api is provided via a foreign-lib.
Whilst this is handy if you don't already have an npm build step, if you do want to depend directly on the
js-joda npm lib you can do so. For more info see the tick docs on [setup for use with ClojureScript](https://github.com/juxt/tick/blob/master/docs/cljs.adoc)
